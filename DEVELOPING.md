# Developing

Thank you for contributing! Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth development process.

## General Guidelines
1. **Fork the repository** before starting development.
2. When committing, ensure your commit messages are:
    - **Clear**: Describe what was changed and why.
    - **Concise**: Avoid overly lengthy or vague messages.

## If You Have Write Access
If you have write access to the repository:
- Always create a **new branch** when working on any potentially breaking changes.
- Use descriptive names for branches (e.g., `add-login`, `typo-in-readme-fix`).
- Test thoroughly before merging your branch into the main codebase.

Thank you for adhering to these practices. They help maintain code quality and make collaboration easier!
